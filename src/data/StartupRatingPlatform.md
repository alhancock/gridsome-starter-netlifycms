## How investable is your startup?

## Can your investor proposition be improved?

Welcome to the Startup Rating Platform. Capital Pilot’s proprietary Assess rating module is designed to take the guesswork and human bias out of investment decisions.
Assess scores startups on 40 different measures in a standardized and objective process.
In less than a week and for only £99 we provide startups with a 10-page rating report with actionable feedback on all aspects of your investor proposition.
Let Assess check your proposition before burning important investor meetings.
The Assess model correlates vast amounts of public and private startup data with future fundraising and longer term outcomes. It learns from this data over time to become ever more accurate in its predictions.
